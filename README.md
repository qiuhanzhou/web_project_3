**Intro**

This is a project that showcases the hometowns of some of Practicum's employees. It is a completely reponsive web page so that all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes.

**Figma**

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.
